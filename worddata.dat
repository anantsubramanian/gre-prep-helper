Iniquity$$$$An iniquity is a really unfair or really immoral act. If you're a journalist, you may uncover a terrible iniquity that forces a famous politician to step down.
Libidinous$$$$When you're libidinous you're driven by your libido, meaning your sex drive. When you describe someone as libidinous, it's usually not a compliment, since the word suggests being out of control with lust and desire.
Licentious$$$$Someone who is licentious behaves or speaks inappropriately, usually in regards to sex.
Reprobate$$$$There's no way around it, a reprobate is a bad egg. The black sheep of the family, missing a moral compass — a reprobate's been called everything from a deviant to an evildoer to a scoundrel.
Ribald$$$$Ribald is an adjective you would use to describe someone who makes dirty sexual jokes. Vulgar, perverted, but still kind of funny — that’s a ribald person.
Salacious$$$$Something salacious is full of juicy details — but they're the kind of raunchy, lusty, dirty details you probably don't want to hear.
Sordid$$$$Describe a person's actions as sordid if they are so immoral or unethical that they seem dirty. Think of the worst parts of a bad soap opera!
Turpitude$$$$If you are guilty of turpitude, you should be ashamed of yourself. Turpitude is a word that represents depraved behavior. Prisons are filled with criminals who have engaged in acts of moral turpitude.
Copy$$$$A copy is a reproduction of something — it looks identical to the original. You might ask your sister to make a copy of your nephew's adorable painting so you can hang it on your fridge.
Counterpart$$$$If you leap tall buildings in a single bound for the Des Moines branch of your corporation, then your Metropolis counterpart might be Superman. That means you and Superman do similar jobs, but in different locations.
Emulate$$$$When you emulate someone, you imitate them, especially with the idea of matching their success.
Facsimile$$$$A facsimile is a copy or reproduction of something. Many parents hope their children will be facsimiles of themselves; many children have other plans in mind.
Factitious$$$$If you create a "diamond" out of plastic, then you’ve created a factitious diamond, meaning that it’s a phony.
Paradigm$$$$A paradigm is a standard, perspective, or set of ideas. A paradigm is a way of looking at something.
Precursor$$$$You've heard the old saying "Pride comes before the fall?" Well, you could just as easily say pride is a precursor to the fall. A precursor is something that happens before something else.
Quintessence$$$$The quintessence of something is its perfect, ideal example. Some people say that the quintessence of American cuisine is the hamburger. Vegetarians may beg to differ.
Simulate$$$$When you simulate something you imitate it. Hollywood makeup artists can use pencils and gray wigs to simulate old age in a young actor. It can also mean to model––a computer can simulate disaster scenarios in cities.
Vicarious$$$$If something is vicarious, it delivers a feeling or experience from someone else. If your child becomes a big star, you might have a vicarious experience of celebrity.
Criticize$$$$To criticize is to find what's wrong with something, like the improbabilities in a movie's plot line, or double standards in your father's rules.
Aspersion$$$$An aspersion is a disparaging remark. It almost invariably appears as a plural, following the word "cast" — when you cast aspersions on someone, you are questioning their abilities or doubting them.
Belittle$$$$To belittle means to put down, or to make another person feel as though they aren't important. Saying mean things about another person literally makes them feel "little."
Berate$$$$A strong verb for harshly cutting someone down with words is berate. "He didn't just correct the cashier who gave him the wrong change, he started to berate her, calling her names in front of the whole store."
Calumny$$$$Use the noun calumny to characterize verbal attacks that are meant to destroy reputations or friendships. You've probably seen political ads during election time that rely on calumny to move voters.
Castigate$$$$Use castigate when you mean reprimand but in an especially harsh way. If you take a mean teacher's books, even accidentally, you might worry that she's going to castigate you as soon as she finds out.
Decry$$$$When you dye your hair pink and orange, your mother decries your act as a horror and bursts into tears. She criticizes your choice of colors, stating that pink and purple would have looked better.
Defame$$$$Even though Joan Jett sang about not minding her bad reputation, most of us don't want others to defame us. To defame is to gossip, even if the story is made-up, with the goal of hurting someone's image.
Denounce$$$$To denounce is to tattle, rat out, or speak out against something. When you stand on your desk and tell the class that your partner is cheating, you denounce him or her.
Deride$$$$The verb deride means to show a low opinion of someone or something. The jerk would deride the other kids on the bus by calling them names or pulling their hair until the driver decided to de-ride him by kicking him off the bus.
Diatribe$$$$It's pretty overwhelming when you ask your friend a seemingly innocuous question, like "Do you like hot dogs?" and she unleashes a diatribe about the evils of eating meat. A diatribe is an angry, critical speech.
Excoriate$$$$When it comes to “telling someone off,” excoriate is reserved for the most severe cases. So, before you excoriate your little sister for borrowing your favorite jacket without permission, consider whether she truly deserves such harsh treatment.
Gainsay$$$$Gainsay, a verb, means "contradict" or "speak out against." When you challenge authority, you gainsay, as in teachers don't like it when unruly students gainsay them.
Harangue$$$$A harangue is more than a speech, louder than a discussion, and nastier than a lecture. It is a verbal attack that doesn't let up, delivered as a verb or received as a noun. Either way, it's pretty unpleasant.
Impugn$$$$To impugn means to call into question or attack as wrong. If your usually grumpy brother is suddenly nice and sweet, you'll impugn his motives if you're smart — he probably just wants something from you.
Inveigh$$$$Picture an old man banging his fist on the dinner table, inveighing against the evils of teenagers being allowed to listen to music and dance. Inveigh means to rail against something with hostility and passion.
Lambaste$$$$To lambaste is to reprimand or berate someone severely. People lambaste those who have angered or disappointed them.
Objurgate$$$$censure severely
Obloquy$$$$If you are on the receiving end of obloquy, then society has turned against you and you are in a state of disgrace. Poor Hester Prynne who was forced to wear a red "A" on her chest for "adultery" knows all about obloquy.
Opprobrium$$$$If you go against or oppose what's good, you might earn opprobrium — the opposite of getting attention for something good. Bad behavior leads to opprobrium. If you throw a soft drink off the theater balcony, the opprobrium might keep you from getting dates to the movies.
Pillory$$$$A pillory is a wooden frame with cutouts for someone's head and hands. Long ago, people found guilty of a crime could be sentenced to be locked in a pillory for a certain amount of time for punishment but also for public humiliation.
Rebuke$$$$If you receive a rebuke, it means that you have been reprimanded, or scolded. You're sure to get a rebuke if you forget to do your math homework four days in a row.
Remonstrate$$$$Remonstrate means to call someone on something that's wrong. If your mother yells at you in public, you might call this getting chewed out. She might call it remonstrating. Either way, it's embarrassing.
Reprehend$$$$express strong disapproval of
Reprove$$$$If you get into trouble and are sent to the principal’s office, be prepared for the principal to reprove you for your behavior. To reprove is to scold, reprimand, or — in plain English — “chew out.”
Revile$$$$If something is reviled, you alone don’t dislike it; a whole community of like-minded souls has to hate its guts. For instance, spam is widely reviled. (The junk e-mails, not the potted meat. Somebody out there really does like that potted meat.)
Vituperate$$$$To vituperate is to speak or write in an extremely negative way about someone.
Death$$$$Death is the end of life. Whether it’s only an instant or it takes years, death is always permanent, no matter what vampire movies try to tell you.

Bereave$$$$deprive through death
Cadaver$$$$A cadaver is a dead human body used in scientific or medical research. If you are dead, you are a corpse, but if Dr. Frankenstein robs your grave so he can use your body for research, you become a cadaver. Umm... congratulations?
Defunct$$$$Defunct describes something that used to exist, but is now gone. A magazine that no longer publishes, like Sassy, the girl-power mag from the '90s, is defunct, for example.
Demise$$$$Resort to the noun demise when you describe the end, termination, or death of something or someone.
Dolorous$$$$Dolorous is not a woman's name (that's Dolores), it is an adjective that describes someone showing great sadness. If your friend Dolores is crying about a lost puppy, you could call her dolorous Dolores.
Elegy$$$$An elegy is a sad poem, usually written to praise and express sorrow for someone who is dead. Although a speech at a funeral is a eulogy, you might later compose an elegy to someone you have loved and lost to the grave.
Knell$$$$A knell is a ringing sound, particularly from a bell tolled to announce a death or the end of something. Which is kind of depressing.
Lament$$$$If you are really upset or sorry about something, you might lament it. A lament is full of regret and grief.

Obsequies$$$$
Sepulchral$$$$Something that reminds you of death is sepulchral. A dreary, misty graveyard at night usually feels sepulchral.
Wraith$$$$If you have a vision of your grandfather just before he passes away, you have seen a wraith or a ghostly image. Wraith can also mean something thin, wispy, or ghost-like.
Abstain$$$$If you abstain from something, you restrain yourself from consuming it. People usually abstain from things that are considered vices — like drinking alcohol or eating chocolate.
Ascetic$$$$Want to live an ascetic lifestyle? Then you better ditch the flat panel TV and fuzzy slippers. To be ascetic, you learn to live without; it's all about self-denial.
Spartan$$$$A spartan existence is kind of like being a monk. Your room is bare, you live simply and eat sparingly, and your sheets are probably scratchy.
Stoic$$$$Being stoic is being calm and almost without any emotion. When you're stoic, you don't show what you're feeling and you also accept whatever is happening.
Temperate$$$$Temperate means mild, moderate. If you're a temperate person, you are calm, reasonable. If you live in a temperate climate it's warm and sunny, but not too hot.
Dictatorial$$$$characteristic of an absolute ruler or absolute rule; having absolute sovereignty
Authoritarian$$$$If your teacher orders you to detention every time you show up to class with a dull pencil, you could probably describe her as an authoritarian — a ruler who prefers order to freedom.

Hegemonic$$$$
Imperious$$$$Someone who is imperious gives orders in a way that shows they feel superior or more important than other people. You might want the smartest kid in the class as your lab partner, but not if they have an imperious attitude and boss you around.
Peremptory$$$$Peremptory comments are like orders. If you say something in a peremptory manner, you want people to stop what they’re doing and do what you say. Peremptory comments put an end to a discussion, and that’s final!
Tyrannical$$$$A tyrannical ruler wields absolute power and authority, and often wields that power unjustly, cruelly, or oppressively.
Ambiguous$$$$Look to the adjective ambiguous when you need to describe something that's open to more than one interpretation, like the headline "Squad helps dog bite victim."
Arcane$$$$Something arcane is understood or known by only a few people. Almost everyone knows the basics of baseball, but only an elite few possess the arcane knowledge of its history that marks the true fan.
Bemusing$$$$To bemuse is to confuse or puzzle. You could bemuse your teacher by writing an essay as a series of haikus, but don’t. Usually a bemused teacher is not a happy one.
Cryptic$$$$"White bunny. Moon. Square." Do you understand what that means? Of course not! It's totally cryptic. Cryptic comments or messages are hard to understand because they seem to have a hidden meaning.
Enigmatic$$$$Something that's enigmatic is tough to figure out. It's puzzling and even mysterious, like those weird secret college societies, Mona Lisa's smile or the New York Times crossword.
Esoteric$$$$Pssst... do you know the secret handshake? If you haven't been brought into the inner circle of those with special knowledge, esoteric things will remain a mystery to you.
Inscrutable$$$$Any person or thing that's mysterious, mystifying, hard to read, or impossible to interpret is inscrutable. You ever notice how it's hard to tell what some people are thinking? Those folks are inscrutable.
Obscure$$$$If something is obscure, it's vague and hard to see. Be careful if you're driving in heavy rain — the painted lines can be obscure.
Opaque$$$$Use the adjective opaque either for something that doesn't allow light to pass through (like a heavy curtain) or for something difficult to understand (like bureaucratic gobbledygook).
Paradoxical$$$$“You have to spend money to make money.” That’s a paradoxical statement used by people in business, and it seems to say two opposite things that contradict each other, but if you think about it, it’s actually kind of true.
Perplexing$$$$The adjective perplexing describes something it is confusing. Before you're fluent in Arabic, you may find the unfamiliar alphabet to be totally perplexing.
Turbid$$$$If a liquid is dark and murky and you can't see through it, it's turbid. It’s usually used as a criticism — a turbid river is generally a polluted one, but then again a good pint of real ale should be turbid. Go figure.
Disgusting$$$$Something disgusting is awful in a way that makes you want to throw up — it's really, really yucky. Nobody likes disgusting things.
Defile$$$$When you defile something, you make it dirty or make it lose its purity. Think of fresh new snow covered in cigarette butts. The butts defile the winter wonderland.
Fetid$$$$If you want to understand the true meaning of fetid, leave your sweaty gym clothes in your locker for a few days. Fetid is a fancy way of saying that something smells really bad.
Invidious$$$$Something can be described as invidious when it is resentful, discriminatory or envious, as in: "Fred was angered by the invidious gossip about his divorce being spread by his ex-wife's allies."
Noisome$$$$If you accidentally leave half a sandwich under your bed for a few days, cover your nose while you sleep because it will probably become quite noisome. This is a fancy way of saying that it will stink.
Odious$$$$If something is odious it's hateful. If you become a historian of slavery, you'll learn all the details of that odious trade.
Putrid$$$$You know that science experiment that used to be lunch that is now rotting in the back of your fridge? Because it's decomposing and stinks to high heaven, you can call it putrid.
Rebarbative$$$$serving or tending to repel
Malodorous$$$$You can use the adjective malodorous as a nicer way to say that something's stinky. Maybe you think your feet smell like roses, but if people move far away when your shoes come off, your rosy feet are probably malodorous.
Articulate$$$$To articulate is to say something. And, if you say it well, someone might praise you by saying you are articulate. Confused yet? It's all in the pronunciation.
Eloquent$$$$When you're eloquent, you have a way with words. An eloquent speaker expresses herself clearly and powerfully. Even though eloquent usually describes oral speech, it can also be used to describe powerful writing.
Evident$$$$If something is evident, it's visible. If you blush furiously and start shaking every time your crush comes near, your infatuation will be evident to everyone.
Limpid$$$$The adjective limpid describes something (often liquid) that is clear, serene and bright. Nature calendars often feature glamour shots of a limpid stream or a limpid lake.
Pellucid$$$$A sentence that teaches a new vocabulary word should always be pellucid, that is, its style and meaning should be easily understandable so that you can derive the definition from the sentence.
Eccentric$$$$You're most likely to encounter the adjective eccentric in a description of an unusual or quirky person — like a scatter-brained aunt who leaves her life savings to her cat.
Aberrant$$$$Use the adjective aberrant to describe unusual conduct. Sitting in a bathtub and singing show tunes all day long might be considered aberrant behavior.
Anachronism$$$$An anachronism is something that doesn't fit its time period, like if you say you'll "dial" your smartphone.
Anomalous$$$$Something that deviates from the norm is anomalous. Something anomalous can be good, such as an exciting new direction in music or art. But that anomalously low score on your math test? Not so good.
Discrete$$$$Discrete means separate or divided. A discrete unit is a separate part of something larger. A room is a discrete space within a house, just as the transmission is a discrete part of a car engine.
Eclectic$$$$She listens to hip-hop, Gregorian chant, and folk music from the '60s. He's been seen wearing a handmade tuxedo jacket over a thrift-store flannel shirt. They both have eclectic tastes.
Esoteric$$$$Pssst... do you know the secret handshake? If you haven't been brought into the inner circle of those with special knowledge, esoteric things will remain a mystery to you.
Iconoclast$$$$Are you always challenging the establishment? Or provoking popular thought by attacking traditions and institutions? Then you're definitely an iconoclast.
Embarrass$$$$If you embarrass someone, you make them feel self-conscious, awkward, or even stupid. Your mom might embarrass you by inviting your date to check out your childhood photos.
Abash$$$$Although abash sounds like a big party or what firefighters do to get through a locked door, abash is, in fact, a verb that means you have caused another person to feel awkward, bashful, embarrassed, or ashamed.
Chagrin$$$$Chagrin is a noun that represents an emotion or feeling and it's an uncomfortable one. If you feel chagrin, it means that you are embarrassed or distressed as a result of a failure.
Compunction$$$$When you feel compunction you feel very, very sorry, usually for something you did to hurt someone or mess something up. When you feel no compunction, you're not at all sorry.
Contrition$$$$In the truest sense, contrition is feeling sorry for committing a religious sin and being scared about the consequences. But anyone can feel general contrition for something they've done wrong.
Diffidence$$$$The noun diffidence refers to a lack of self-confidence. Your diffidence might be the reason why you never say "hi" to the cute guy or gal in the elevator or why you never ask for a raise.
Expiate$$$$In the fairy tale, the baker must expiate his father’s sins by bringing the witch three ingredients for a magic potion: a cow, a cape and a slipper. Expiate means to make amends or atone for a wrong you or someone else has committed.
Foible$$$$If you repeat foible out loud enough times, it sounds so funny that you can laugh at it and maybe remember to laugh at the odd and distinctive weaknesses of others — the foible or two or a hundred that we all have.
Gaucherie$$$$the quality of being rustic or gauche
Rue$$$$To rue is to feel regret or remorse for something. If that position at the deli ended up involving a reality TV show that made everyone famous, you may rue the day you turned down the job.
Canard$$$$During a political campaign, you will often hear on TV commercials some canard about the opponent. This is a false, deluding statement designed to confuse the voters, as it presents the other candidate in a bad light by spreading an untruth.
Chicanery$$$$Have you ever gotten the sense that politicians or corporate leaders will say anything to turn public opinion their way? This tricky kind of deceit and manipulation is called chicanery.
Dissemble$$$$To dissemble is to hide under a false appearance, to deceive. "When confronted about their human rights record, the Chinese government typically dissembles."

Erroneous$$$$The adjective erroneous describes something or someone as mistaken and incorrect. Early explorers had the erroneous notion that the oceans were full of dragons.
Ersatz$$$$The ersatz version of something is an inferior substitute or imitation. Instant coffee would be considered ersatz to a freshly brewed cup made from hand-ground Costa Rican beans.
Fallacious$$$$Something fallacious is a mistake that comes from too little information or unsound sources. Predictions that the whole state of California will snap off from the rest of North America and float away have proven to be fallacious — for now, anyway.
Feigned$$$$Feigned is an adjective that means "not genuine," like your feigned interest in your friends' discussion of celebrity hairstyle trends.
Guile$$$$Use the noun guile for cunning, craftiness, and artful duplicity. Acting like you have a job on Wall Street when you're actually unemployed would take a lot of guile.
Mendacious$$$$A mendacious person is one who tells lies habitually and intentionally. Don't get stuck at the water cooler or bus stop next to someone you consider mendacious!
Perfidy$$$$If you shared your most embarrassing secrets with a friend who then told them to everyone he knows, his betrayal could be described as perfidy.
Specious$$$$Use specious to describe an argument that seems to be good, correct, or logical, but is not so. We live on the earth, therefore the earth must be the center of the universe has been proven to be a specious theory of the solar system.
Spurious$$$$Something false or inauthentic is spurious. Don't trust spurious ideas and stories. Spurious statements often are lies, just as a spurious coin is a counterfeit coin — a fake.
Conjugal$$$$The adjective conjugal describes all husband-and-wife matters, so if someone who is married says, "Single people don't understand how I feel," you can be sure it's a conjugal situation.
Consanguine$$$$Use the adjective consanguine to describe two people who are biologically related to each other. For example, a grandmother and her grandson are consanguine.
Distaff$$$$the staff on which wool or flax is wound before spinning
Endogamous$$$$characterized by or fit for fertilization by pollen from another flower of the same kind

Favoring$$$$A favor is an act of kindness, like doing your friend a favor by letting her borrow your calculator to take the big math test.
Ardent$$$$If you are ardent, you are passionate about something. A pop star's ardent admirers might go so crazy at his concert that they faint from excitement.
Doctrinaire$$$$You've doubtless met someone doctrinaire at some point. You know them by their complete unwillingness to accept any belief other than their own.
Partisan$$$$If something is prejudicial towards a particular point of view, you can call it partisan. You'll often hear of the partisan politics in the US — since politicians seem to be so devoted to either the Republican or Democratic parties.
Tendentious$$$$If you are writing a report on climate change, and ignore evidence that the earth is warming, the paper might be called tendentious. Tendentious means promoting a specific, and controversial, point of view.
Zealot$$$$The hamburger zealot was so fanatical about his burgers that he camped outside his favorite fast-food joint for hours every morning, waiting for it to open. And he would never put mustard on them, only ketchup.
Absolve$$$$To be absolved is to be let off the hook, to be set free from a certain obligation or to be forgiven for a wrongdoing. The Church may absolve you of your sins, but that won't absolve you of the need to attend mass.
Acquit$$$$To acquit someone is to clear them of charges. Acquitting also has to do with how you carry or present yourself.
Exculpate$$$$To exculpate means to find someone not guilty of criminal charges. If you've been wrongly accused of robbery, you'd better hope a judge will exculpate you, unless you want to go to jail because you've heard prison food is amazing.
Exonerate$$$$To exonerate someone is to declare him not guilty of criminal charges. This word is pretty much only used in reference to proceedings in a court of law. A word with a similar meaning that might be familiar is “acquit.”

Vindicate$$$$Vindicate means to justify, prove, or reinforce an idea — or to absolve from guilt. If your family thinks you hogged the last piece of pie on Thanksgiving, you'll be vindicated when your younger brother fesses up.
Chortle$$$$A chortle is a joyful, partly muffled laugh. If you have a toddler, you will recognize the sound of a delighted chortle, sort of louder and a bit more raucous than a giggle.
Droll$$$$Need a mental picture for the word droll? Think of one of those cute-homely troll dolls — blend those two words together — "doll" and "troll" — and you get droll, a description of a figure that is adorably strange and whimsically cute.
Flippant$$$$When a parent scolds a teenager for missing a curfew or blowing off a test and the teen snaps back, "Whatever," you could say the teen is being flippant. His reply was casual to the point of sarcasm and disrespect.
Gibe$$$$"Loser! Bonehead!" the kids shouted, tossing those words and other gibes at the people who offered themselves up to the annual humiliation of the harvest-fest dunk-tank. A gibe is an insulting comment. To gibe is to insult.
Jocular$$$$Do you like to make a lot of jokes? Are you often silly? Are you usually happy? If so, then you are a jocular person.
Levity$$$$Joking that your dead grandmother "never looked better" could inject some levity, or frivolity, into her funeral, but your relatives might find your joke inappropriate to the occasion.
Ludicrous$$$$Ludicrous things are funny, absurd, or nonsensical. If someone says something silly or far-fetched, you could say "That's ludicrous!"
Raillery$$$$Use the noun raillery to describe a kind of joking or gentle teasing. There will probably be a bit of raillery between elementary school students on a field trip bus, for example.
Riposte$$$$A riposte is a clever comeback, one of those witty responses that you usually think after the fact — when it's too late to say them.
Abatement$$$$An abatement is a deduction, or lessening. If you start bluntly telling people what you think of them, you might see an abatement in their friendliness toward you.
Aperture$$$$An aperture is an opening, usually a small one. “If you can thread the silk through that aperture and pull it out the other side, we can knot it and create a loop.”
Fissure$$$$A long fine crack in the surface of something is called a fissure. If you see a fissure in the ice on a frozen lake, you'll want to take off your skates and head back to the car.
Hiatus$$$$A temporary gap, pause, break, or absence can be called a hiatus. When your favorite TV show is on hiatus, that means there are no new episodes — not forever, just for a little while.
Interregnum$$$$Interregnum describes the period between the reigns of two leaders. If you're a rebel leader, you may try to gain power during an interregnum.
Interstice$$$$Use the noun interstice to mean a tiny gap, like the interstice between your curtains which lets in a thin slice of morning sunlight.
Lull$$$$See lull, think "calm." It could be the noun form (like "the lull before the storm") or the verb: one can lull someone by calming them (as in lulling a baby to sleep with a lullaby).
Orifice$$$$An orifice is an opening or a hole, most often in the body, such as your mouth or your nostril.

Respite$$$$A respite is a break from something that's difficult or unpleasant. If you're cramming for exams, take an occasional walk to give yourself a respite from the intensity.
Rift$$$$Rift sounds like rip, and it's helpful to think of it that way. When there is a rift in a political party over how much taxes to pay, it is like a rip or tear in the fabric of the group.
Altruistic$$$$Someone who is altruistic always puts others first. An altruistic firefighter risks his life to save another's life, while an altruistic mom gives up the last bite of pie so her kid will be happy.
Beneficent$$$$Beneficent is the type of act that helps others. If you're a beneficent person, you probably spend a lot of your time volunteering at soup kitchens or homeless shelters, helping people who are less fortunate than you are.
Clement$$$$Clement weather is lovely and mild. You might describe a beautiful, warm summer evening as clement.
Largess$$$$liberality in bestowing gifts; extremely liberal and generous of spirit
Magnanimous$$$$A magnanimous person has a generous spirit. Letting your little sister have the last of the cookies, even though you hadn't eaten since breakfast, would be considered a magnanimous act.
Philanthropic$$$$Something given to help others is philanthropic. Money, household items, giving your time and energy to a cause — all can be philanthropic contributions.
Unstinting$$$$very generous
Avaricious$$$$Someone who is avaricious is greedy or grasping, concerned with gaining wealth. The suggestion is that an avaricious person will do anything to achieve material gain, and it is, in general, not a pleasant attribute.
Covetous$$$$To be covetous of something is to want it and to be a little jealous of anyone who has it. The advertising industry’s goal is to make you covetous of the things that other people have — that way, you'll buy them.
Mercenary$$$$You might not want to call a mercenary a "hireling" to his face, but a mercenary is, after all, a soldier who gets paid to fight where needed, sometimes taking a heroic stand and other times just wanting payment for fighting.
Miserly$$$$Miserly people are stingy with their money and not likely to be generous, like Ebenezer Scrooge himself.
Penurious$$$$Don't have two nickels to rub together? You're penurious — a lovely long way of saying you're flat broke.

Venal$$$$Someone with venal motives is corrupt and maybe a little evil. Nobody wants to be thought of as venal.
Asperity$$$$Asperity is the harsh tone or behavior people exhibit when they’re angry, impatient, or just miserable. When your supervisor’s “Late again!” greeting causes your entire future to pass before your eyes, he is speaking with asperity.
Baleful$$$$Baleful means the foreshadowing of tragic or evil events. If no one's listening in class and your teacher reprimands you with a baleful glance, expect a pop quiz.
Dour$$$$Dour describes something sullen, gloomy, or persistent. You might look dour on your way to picking up your last check from the job you just got fired from, and people should get out of your way.
Fell$$$$Something that has been felled has been brought down, like a tree that has been felled by a powerful storm.
Malevolent$$$$If someone is malevolent, they wish evil on others. If you find yourself approaching someone with a malevolent look in her eye, best to run the other way.
Sardonic$$$$If someone is being scornful and mocking in a humorous way, call her sardonic. If you want to write comic sketches for late-night talk shows, work on being sardonic.

Salutary$$$$Use salutary to describe something that's good for your health, like the salutary benefits of exercise, laughter, and getting enough sleep every night.

Cavil$$$$If your only cavil to your family's trip to Disney World is that you don't like airline food, you're not representing the anti-Mickey side of the argument very well. A cavil is a small or petty objection.
Exhort$$$$French roots for the word exhort mean "thoroughly encourage," so to exhort is to fill up with encouragement! "When he heard the crowd exhort him with stomping and cheers, he knew that he could finish the marathon."
Hector$$$$To hector is to boss around or verbally bully someone. An older brother might hector his little sister until she hands over part of her Halloween candy.

Archaic$$$$If you use the adjective archaic you are referring to something outmoded, belonging to an earlier period. Rotary phones and cassette players already seem so archaic!

Eon$$$$An eon is a really, really, super-long, impossible-to-measure length of time. If you sit down to dinner hanging your head and moaning that it's been an eon since you ate anything, you’re exaggerating. Four hours ago is not an eon.
Ephemeral$$$$Something that is fleeting or short-lived is ephemeral, like a fly that lives for one day or text messages flitting from cellphone to cellphone.

Trepidation$$$$When plain old "fear" isn't enough to get across a deep feeling of dread about something on the horizon, use the more formal word trepidation.

Verity$$$$If your friend tells you she saw a UFO yesterday afternoon, you might be inclined to question the verity, or truthfulness, of her statement. Everyone knows UFOs are only visible at night.
